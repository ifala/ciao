        <p> Hi folks! I'm Giacomo Falaschi, I'm a 32 year-old Tuscan guy, based in a very small town called Contea where, with some friends I funded a <a href="http:/fablabcontea.blogspot.com">FabLab</a>, perhaps the smallest one of Italy.I have always been interested in sports, such as snowboarding, kayaking, enduro and downhill. I first got in touch with digital fabrication through the <a href="http:/www.reprap.org">RepRap</a> world, several years ago. Since then I have been experiencing various types of 3d printing and experimenting with different kinds of machines ad materials.</p>

    <div class="small-12 medium-6 columns">
        <p> While doing this, I realized the importance of a collaboration between different knowledges and people: that's what brought me to fund a FabLab in my small town. Knowing that 3d printing is only one of the infinite possibilities to "create almost anything" I am here at the <a href="http:/fabacademy.org">Fab Academy</a> to improve my basic skills and learn lots of new things. Being familiar with mechanic movement, I look forward to make this knowledge interact with some less known (for me) areas, such as electronics and software design.</p>

        <p>Thanks to my job I had the chance to live for 7 years with the guy who introduced me to the digital fabrication, 
	  <br><a href="http://www.syskrak.org">Giuseppe Porsia (1984-2013)</a>.
	  <br>
	  <br>
	  Also for not letting his memory and the projects we where thinking about together fade away, I decided to pursuit my experience in this area.</p>
