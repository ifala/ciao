### Weekly_Assignments :

-    mill, solder and programming FabISP

### to mill fab isp key v 2.3

****

to mill with [fabisp key version 2.3](http://fab.cba.mit.edu/content/projects/fabispkey/index.html)

using [Fab Modules](http://fabmodules.org/) and Roland MDX-20 Modela.

I used :

- 1/64" end mills bit for milling the traces

- 1/32" end mills for cut the fab isp key out of the "copper sheet"

![mini]({{ site.url }}/images/week/4/mill/fabisp_drd.png)

Useful to prevent a MDX-20 damage, is place a "sacrifical layer" on the bottom of the copper sheet

*sacrifical layer* 
material layer placed under the copper plate, sacrificial in case of an increased pressure of the drill tip

### to solder

****

I start to understand the [schematic plane](http://fab.cba.mit.edu/content/projects/fabispkey/hw/fabispkey/docs/fabisp_sch.png) of the board and I find on the web (last years classes) a good bill of materials.
thanks to the "istructor tricks" it was very fast soldering components.

- heat the track with the tip of the welder
- add solder in track
- lock the component on the solder added
- weld pressing the opposite side of the component

**Useful tools**

- tweezers (for take the component)
- copper braid (in case of extra tin)
- tin with flux (for precise and fast welds)
- biadhesive (to immobilize the board to the table)
- lamp (for not to become blind)

during the soldering, I found very annoying skip and serach in my phone these three images, so I decided to collect them and put them close, in a single screen. I think is more easy when you proceed with soldering.
I created a table list of material in order by soldering (suggest)

**Final result without AVR3x2**

### firmware upload from arduino uno

****
- install avr software (for mac users) and download [firmware](http://www.as220.org/fabacademy/downloads/fabISP_mac.0.8.2_firmware.zip)
- [set arduino uno as isp](http://highlowtech.org/?p=1695)

[follow tutorial here](http://highlowtech.org/?p=1706) to find the coresponding pin od arduino

![o]({{ site.url }}/images/week/4/programming/1.jpg)

power fabisp through port usb and connect with arduino :

![o]({{ site.url }}/images/week/4/programming/3.jpg)

**important** Modify make file inside firmware folder and uncomment

- AVRDUDE = avrdude -c arduino -P /dev/cu.usbmodem1451 -p $(DEVICE) # edit this line for your programmer

go with terminal inside the firmware folder and:

- make clean
- make hex
- sudo make fuse
