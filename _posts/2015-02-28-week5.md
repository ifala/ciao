### Weekly_Assignments :

- Design and 3D print an object that could not be made subtractively 
- Scan and print an object

### Solidworks design superGroviera

****

I wanted to look for a design that would allow me to test the limits of my 3d printer as well as perform the assignment.
so I searched in [thingverse ](http://www.thingiverse.com/search?q=test&sa=) some inspiration design for test the accuracy of my printer after **"overhang hole"**

I create a **super groviera slice**
***cheese style slice, to test the aesthetic outcome of the printer after the execution of overhang hole***

- ***test hole finiture***
- ***test overhang***
- ***complex internal hole geometry, to test the possible "steps loss"***
- ***test external finiture after internal complex geometry***

*"the hole geometry is parametric! you can change the first hole diameter, and automatically other hole assume +1mm Left +0.1 top -0.1 bottom"*

*"inside the superGroviera there is 2 tubular profiles which intersecting the holes test"*

### Cura slicing setting

****
For this assignment I used [Cura slicer](https://www.google.com/search?client=safari&rls=en&q=cura+slicer&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8)
with this settings:

![o]({{ site.url }}/images/week/5/project/cura4.jpg){:width="300px"}
![o]({{ site.url }}/images/week/5/project/cura5.jpg){:width="300px"}

*to improve the external face resolution I lowered the outer shell and top/bottom speed.*

*"lots of hole overhang! red marked"*
*"the preview says 1h and 28min .. that's ok ! ..is an acceptable time"*

![o]({{ site.url }}/images/week/5/project/cura1.jpg)

*"on the top menu, select view mode > Transparent"*

![o]({{ site.url }}/images/week/5/project/cura3.jpg){:width="300px"}

*"view mode > Layers"*

*"the hole geometry is parametric! you can change the first hole diameter, and automatically other hole assume +1mm Left +0.1 top -0.1 bottom"*

### 3d scan

****
- install [skanect](http://skanect.occipital.com) 
- install [set arduino uno as isp](http://highlowtech.org/?p=1695)

[follow tutorial here](http://highlowtech.org/?p=1706) to find the coresponding pin od arduino
**saverio scan**
