# Solidworks design a "superGroviera"

****

I was looking for a design that would allow me to test the limits of my 3d printer as well as perform the assignment, and to improve my solidworks skill.
so I searched in [thingverse ](http://www.thingiverse.com/search?q=test&sa=) some inspiration design for test the accuracy of my printer after lots of **"overhang hole"**

I create a **super groviera slice**
***cheese GROVIERA style slice***, to test the aesthetic outcome of the printer ***after the execution of overhang hole***

- ***test hole finiture***
- ***test overhang***
- ***complex internal hole geometry, to test the possible "steps loss"***
- ***test external finiture after internal complex geometry***


![o]({{ site.url }}/images/week/5/project/solidworks.jpg )
*"the hole geometry is parametric! you can change the first hole diameter, and automatically other hole assume +1mm Left +0.1 top -0.1 bottom"*

![o]({{ site.url }}/images/week/5/project/solidworks1.jpg)
*"inside the superGroviera there is 2 tubular profiles which intersect the holes test and create a lots of internal critical overhang "*

# Cura slicing setting

****

For this assignment I used [Cura slicer](https://www.google.com/search?client=safari&rls=en&q=cura+slicer&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8)
with this settings:

![o]({{ site.url }}/images/week/5/project/cura4.jpg){:width="300px"}
![o]({{ site.url }}/images/week/5/project/cura5.jpg){:width="300px"}

*to improve the external face resolution I lowered the outer shell and top/bottom speed.*

![o]({{ site.url }}/images/week/5/project/cura.jpg)

*"lots of hole overhang! red marked"*
*"the preview says 1h and 28min .. that's ok ! ..is an acceptable time"*

![o]({{ site.url }}/images/week/5/project/cura1.jpg)

*"on the top menu, select view mode > Transparent"*

the internal curved tube profile disturbs and influences the costruction of the external perimeters.

![o]({{ site.url }}/images/week/5/project/cura3.jpg){:width="300px"}

*"view mode > Layers"*

![o]({{ site.url }}/images/week/5/supergrov/superGroviera1.jpg)

*"I try to use photoshop to exalt the error of the machine."*

- Red marked - error after overhang
- Blue marked - spool block
 
![o]({{ site.url }}/images/week/5/supergrov/superGroviera2.jpg)

*"more than overhang !"*

![o]({{ site.url }}/images/week/5/supergrov/superGroviera3.jpg)

*"black and white photo..in the first part of the print, you can see "waves of reverb", due to the high speed printing and possibly extruder temperature too high"*

# 3d scan - kinect Xbox 360

****

![o]({{ site.url }}/images/week/5/kinect.jpg)

- install [nvidia CUDA](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads) for enable skanect-GPU
- install [skanect](http://skanect.occipital.com) 

###Start to scan! 


With fablab contea guys, I try 2 different type of scan:

- with the subject that **turns on itself** on a swivel chair moving the kinect from top to bottom
- with **subject locked**, turning around with the scanect

##Turn itself

![o]({{ site.url }}/images/week/5/scan/saverioPC1.jpg)

*"Saverio can't stand still if try turn itself with his legs, someone helped me to turn the chair during the scan"*

![o]({{ site.url }}/images/week/5/scan/saverioPC.jpg)




##Subject locked
![o]({{ site.url }}/images/week/5/scan/saverioPC2.jpg)

*"Saverio remains like frozen about a minute while I have scanned him"*

![o]({{ site.url }}/images/week/5/scan/saverioPC3.jpg)

*"Saverio remain like frozen about a minute while I have scanned him"*


## 3d printing
I tryed to print the *subject loked* scan version.
I scaled at 0.13 % the scan result, and for improve the print quality, I lowered the layer height at 0.12 using 0.3 mm extruder.
In the *subject loked* scan version was scan face and half body, the time of print at 0.12 LH is 4.00 h, so I decided to 'cut off object bottom', for arrive at 1.30 h of print time.
During this printing I preferred not using any support type. 

![o]({{ site.url }}/images/week/5/scan/saverioPC6.jpg)

*"infill = 0% the inside head is empty"*

![mini]({{ site.url }}/images/week/5/scan/saverioPC7.jpg)
 ![mini]({{ site.url }}/images/week/5/scan/saverioPC8.jpg)
 ![normal]({{ site.url }}/images/week/5/scan/saverioPC4.jpg)

*"with (layer height) 0.12, is like impossible see single layer height "*

![o]({{ site.url }}/images/week/5/scan/saverioPC5.jpg)

*"the final result is good (except for overhang errors), but the scan was scaled too much, so I have lost a lot of definition"*
