#Project: ping pong paddle 

### introduction

****

Spring being in the air and hot weather arriving, I wanted to live again my long and hot hours spent playing tennis table in the very same room of the newborn FabLab Contea I run. 
I started looking for all the infos needed to build a tennis table paddle as professional as possible.
After investigating on the patents (almost all of them has expired) to check the correct measurements, I projected my own racket trying to suit the international rules (at least 80% wooden composition).
The composit project I am going to create will be linen, balsa and epoxy resin.


### Mill. Press. Form

Before proceeding with the laser cutting of the components, I wanted to create a sample. So I milled a positive and a negative of the racket, in order to better use the vacuum seal. p


### Laser parts
Since the layers forming my composit material project are very thin, I decided to cut them with the laser.
For me this is a new eperience, since I had never tried cutting fibers like linen with laser cut. 

### Milling the handle
The longest and most delicate milling is the one for the curved part of the handle.
It will be glued to the main body of the paddle.

##Final finishing

On the two faces of the paddle, where the surface is smooth, I will glue two sheets of plastic and rubber and put it again under pressure until the glue dries.


I now cut the exceeding parts of the sheets...and my own paddle is ready.

#Conclusion

****

Since I was very young, I played tennis table with my father. He used to have his own paddle he made with his own hands, even if it was terrible and I was even unable to use it. I never really got over this. What a better payback than building my own paddle?


I wonder if my paddle suits the official rules of the International Tennis Table Federation (ITTS) or if it can be used in a regular championship...or in a match at my place?
