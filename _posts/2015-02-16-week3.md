### Weekly_Assignments :

-    design, make, and document a press-fit construction kit

the task this week was to design and build a press fit kit, using vinyl cutter and lasercut. in addition to our instructor asked us to create extra credit as a vinyl sticker.

#### intro...

during searches of examples of joints I stumbled upon this method of work of the cardboard

as understood [in this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xHAbRAXBko) at the 2:00 minute

[![cardboard curve](http://img.youtube.com/vi/9xHAbRAXBko/0.jpg)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xHAbRAXBko)

The video shows how it is possible to bend the cardboard perfectly simply cutting the opposite side.

#### the idea

Often in the laboratory support my macbook pro over tables or with dusty debris that could scratch my precious laptop ...
so before you buy an item like this, which although very nice cost a fortune, [400 dollars to put](http://thegadgetflow.com/portfolio/vool-wooden-laptop-stand) your laptop on this beautiful prestigious wood!

I want to use this assignment to create a configurator parametric laptop stand.

- with waste of cardboard or wood
- that can be easily mounted by press fit joint
- incorporating vinyl to make it more cute and less anonymous

#### workflow

###### - after writing some notes on paper and the bad code in OpenSCAD, 
These are the settings to be included in OpenSCAD, to generate your own laptop stand, of course, in addition to the kerf=K

<img src="{{ site.url }}/images/week/3/appome/workflow/quotatura.png">
I included the measures of my mac and controlled via the export in DXF, the actual measurements of the cardboard/vinil to be cut.

#### to start I tried using sketchup

#### conclusion 

OpenSCAD also has several shared libraries, from which you can import objects, definitely a great open source program with great potential, it is almost impossible to export objects manifold, so it seems a good compromise for my final project.
