### Weekly_Assignments :

-    design, make, and document a press-fit construction kit

the task this week was to design and build a press fit kit, using vinyl cutter and lasercut. in addition to our instructor asked us to create extra credit as a vinyl sticker.

#### intro...

during searches of examples of joints I stumbled upon this method of work of the cardboard

as understood [in this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xHAbRAXBko) at the 2:00 minute

[![cardboard curve](http://img.youtube.com/vi/9xHAbRAXBko/0.jpg)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xHAbRAXBko)

The video shows how it is possible to bend the cardboard perfectly simply cutting the opposite side.

#### the idea

Often in the laboratory support my macbook pro over tables or with dusty debris that could scratch my precious laptop ...
so before you buy an item like this, which although very nice cost a fortune, [400 dollars to put](http://thegadgetflow.com/portfolio/vool-wooden-laptop-stand) your laptop on this beautiful prestigious wood!

I want to use this assignment to create a configurator parametric laptop stand.

- with waste of cardboard or wood
- that can be easily mounted by press fit joint
- incorporating vinyl to make it more cute and less anonymous

#### workflow

##### Parametric project and test

****

###### - after writing some notes on paper and the bad code in OpenSCAD, 
These are the settings to be included in OpenSCAD, to generate your own laptop stand, of course, in addition to the kerf=K

<img src="{{ site.url }}/images/week/3/appome/workflow/quotatura.png">

I put in the measures of my mac,and the measures of cardboard (thikness and wheelbase dimples) and export in DXF just uncomment ---> remove "//" the 2 line after //+++++++++++Laser Cut cardboard (press F6 and export DXF)  ---> remove "(//)"

###### //+++++++++++Laser Cut cardboard (press F6 and export DXF)

> translate([X+P+X/5+K+K+10,0,0]) projection(cut = false) rotate([0,0,90]) layerdown();

> projection(cut = false) overup();

I have also created a small test, in order to understand the power of the laser cutting and verify the cuts in the flexible section of the project.

###### //+++++++++++Test laser cut cardboard

> projection(cut = false) testlaser();

##### modify in Autocad 

###### - OpenSCAD unfortunately does not export the colors, so I was forced to use autocad to open the dxf and change the color of the cuts to be made

begin editing the file to test the power to apply to lasercut..

##### Lasercut!

****

###### - Unfortunately we can not use the fabmodules to send in cutting, but we have to create a pdf and send the job directly from the PC connected to the lasercut.

	<figcaption>although I had set the laser at 10% power, the cardboard is completely broken, failure!</figcaption>
</figure>

After a few minutes of discouragement, I realized that the cardboad was different from that used by the cutting test .

Little research into the FabLab and I found another piece of cardboard the same of Test laser cut, in the meantime, my instructor asked me to change the parameters to test directly on his macbook air the project.

#### to start I tried using sketchup

#### conclusion 

OpenSCAD also has several shared libraries, from which you can import objects, definitely a great open source program with great potential, it is almost impossible to export objects manifold, so it seems a good compromise for my final project.
