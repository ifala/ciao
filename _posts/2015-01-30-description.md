<div>
    <br/>
    Here you are some sketches for my project

    I am really interested in creating a modular project and in experimenting with different harware interfacing with each other. My idea is to build a project made of different Lego-styled cubes, each of which is able to interact with the other similar units. 
    <br/>
    <img src="{{ site.url }}/images/local/render1_low.jpg" />
    <br/>
    Each of these cubes will have 5 identical faces to connect with the other units, while the sixth face will twist on its own axes using a servo motor and reduction gears.
    <br/>
    <img src="{{ site.url }}/images/local/render2_low.jpg" />
    <br/>
    On each of the 5 connecting faces, thare will be 4 Lego-styled pins connecting each unit to the others both mechanically and electronically. The whole object will be made of as many units as you wish and will serve as a twisting robotic arm, cubic snake or anything your hidden childish imagination can think about.

    On this page you can see some sketches made with SketchUp, but I will be using Solid Works or Rhino to design and build the final project.

    I am also planning a blog focusing the developpement of this final project, that will be separeted by the weekly assignment posts.
        
<br/>
    Operative planning:
    <br/>
    - cube design (on Solid Works or Rhino)
    <br/>
    - cube movement gear design
    <br/>
    - electronic boards for movement
    <br/>
    - electronics boards for interactions between cubes
    <br/>
    - panel control interaction (hardware)
    <br/>
    - panel control interaction (software)
    <br/>
    - additional aesthetic design (lights and sounds according to '90s Lego style)
    <br/>
    - multiply units to build the final Twister
