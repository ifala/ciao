#Twister Joystick  two-faced 

### Eagle design

****

As described in my [schedule page]({{ site.url }}//finalproject/schedule/) for my final project I will need an hardware panel control.
I'm really interested to step response project like [touchpad](http://fab.cba.mit.edu/classes/MIT/863.10/people/matt.blackshaw/week8.html) and [multitouch](http://fab.cba.mit.edu/classes/863.11/people/matthew.keeter/multitouch/index.html).
For my joystick (hardware panel control), I need only 4 button (I want to be sensitive to the touch) and one RGB led.

- 2 pads for turn (clockwise and counterclockwise)
- 1 pads for change cube (switch to another cube)
- 1 pads for change the color of the cube 
- RGB led for visualizing the color cube changing

![normal]({{ site.url }}/images/week/10/monocrome/sch.png)

The board have 1M resistor in corrispondence of the step trace, and 3x 100 ohm resistor for RGB led 
I read the value on datasheet and apply the formula for find the exact color resistor R=(V-Vdrop)/I where:

Example For Red pin (rgb smd led)

- V= 5v
- Vdrop = 2v
- I = 0.02

= 150ohm (in this case in accord with my local istructor I use a 100 ohm resistor)

![normal]({{ site.url }}/images/week/10/monocrome/topebottom.png) 

during the design of the tace I had some problems with avr VCC , so I decided to power my board (also during the its programming) with USB-FTDI. 

I design the back board in eagle with rgb led and the reference blue-square which correspond to the hole on the front side board.
In prevision to import all file in illustrator for design the back board's step, I designed the square on eagle slightly more large in order to prevent the missing correspondence during the milling.

#Milling Board two-faced

![normal]({{ site.url }}/images/week/10/monocrome/offsett+reference.jpg) 


I imported all file in illustrator for design the distance between the "reference point" and the boarder on holes.png file, needful for mill the back of the board.

![mini]({{ site.url }}/images/week/10/monocrome/offset_fabmodules.jpg)

Despite my note, I don't have add start-offset, set on the front layer, so I wrong the first try of my twofaced board...!

Then remenber that back board is mirrored on Y axes and ADD start-offset (adding on the first layer), remember it when you mill the board!


My local instructor suggest me to use a resistor wire to solder the passageways from front to bottom board, very fast and easy!

#Programming!

****

I download the code of [tinymidi - fiore basile](http://fabacademy.org/archives/2014/students/basile.fiore/classes/10_input_devices.html)and I modified the code by using my output and input corresponding pin. 

After some test, I lower threshold value: 

|#define down_threshold 700|--> #define down_threshold 500|
|#define down_threshold 740|--> #define up_threshold 550|

I studied the tinymidi C code, that was perfect for my future application, but I want make in the future a new variant or simply use a neil python for measure the effective touch sensing.

#Conclusion
****

I'm really happy in this moment, because for the first time I design a new one board without anybody's help, I understand now something about eletronics, capacitor, resistor , diode, and also something new about AVR programming!

For lack of time, I wasn't able to develop an interface that would allow me to see move the twister cube with the variables sent by my joystick via usb-FTDI, definitely want to do it!
