### Weekly_Assignments :

- model (draw, render, animate, simulate, ...) a possible final project, and post it on your class page

#### logos and much more...

starting with the 2d of my project, trying to be as faithful as possible to the model then I will go to realize in 3d, I started trying to bring the correct measurements of the main face, the one that allows the rotation.

<figure class="half">
	<img src="{{ site.url }}/images/week/2/illustrator/sketch1.jpg"></a>
	<img src="{{ site.url }}/images/week/2/illustrator/sketch2.jpg"></a>
</figure>
<figure class="half">
	<img src="{{ site.url }}/images/week/2/illustrator/sketch3.jpg"></a>
	<img src="{{ site.url }}/images/week/2/illustrator/sketch3final_logo.jpg"></a>
</figure>

With this type of approach can realize the minimum distances to be observed, in fact the holes (colored) or in relief, must have a minimum distance from the part that allows the rotation. 
I enjoyed playing a little with the various shades of the 4 colors, and then arrive at a result that satisfies me visually. 

ok at this point we have a vector file to be used also for the LOGO! Once you save the logo in various sizes, I updated the site.

	<img src="{{ site.url }}/images/apple-touch-icon-144x144-precomposed.png">

# [sketchup](http://www.sketchup.com)

#### to start I tried using sketchup

<figure class="half">
	<img src="{{ site.url }}/images/week/2/sketchup/vers1_up.jpg"></a>
	<img src="{{ site.url }}/images/week/2/sketchup/vers1_down.jpg"></a>
</figure>

during these two years of the project [falla3d](http://www.falla3d.com ) I have often used this program, and then 'was very easy to start from here

#### sketchup problems

> - poor attitude to handle curved shapes
> - sketchup is not parametric!

#### conclusion

I probably will not use this program for my final project, although I found it very useful to use the library modules online, such as servo motors, to understand the dimensions of the servo motor and twistercube.

#### As time has gone!

#####[wikibooks manual](http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/OpenSCAD_User_Manual)

OpenSCAD I always liked so much, the thrill of writing code and wait for the result quickly becomes a drug ... hahah

#### openscad problems

> - render only on request
> - You have so much code to write!

![openscad](/images/week/2/openscad/openscad_interface.jpg)

#### conclusion 

OpenSCAD also has several shared libraries, from which you can import objects, definitely a great open source program with great potential, it is almost impossible to export objects manifold, so it seems a good compromise for my final project.
