#Parametric Design

### Solidworks

****

For improve my skill in solidworks I tried design the tshelf parametric.

#####- I wanted decide the base of the triangle 

#####- I wanted decide the thikness of material 

#####- I wanted design the joints ready to milling (without processing with other sorftware after export by solidworks) so I want include the drill tip in my design.

because I don't know were I will go to milling, which dimension will be the panel to be milled, the dimension of the drill tip... I want my file in solidworks ready for milling everywere with any material ( thikness and dimension of panel )

![normal]({{ site.url }}/images/week/8/design/4.jpg)

- In this file version (I think the correct version) I dimension a joint proportionally by the milling tip.

#Go to milling 

####cnc shapoko-FabLab Cascina

### First try, first error

	It's sunday (23/03), and I decided to go to milling ! 

####workflow

- measure the dimension and thikness of table to milling

- insert the dimension in the parametric file

- Look  the pre-assemble test preview

- Export in DXF format

- Create Gcode in CAMBAM software**

- Open Gcode-file in LinuxCNC**

- Fix the table/material over the CNC plane**

- Trun ON the spindle

- turn on the suction (aspiration)

- Set Zero CNC point (X,Y,Z)**

- Start to Mill

![normal]({{ site.url }}/images/week/8/error/1.jpg)

![normal]({{ site.url }}/images/week/8/error/3.jpg)

Error.! in the first version of my design, the joint have the side of the chord of the circle is less than the size of the drill tip, so the joint is compromised!

	(sunday at 11.35 PM - The tip of the cutter leaves us)

I wondered why, I was worried it was wrong cambam or LinuxCNC settings, my instructor, explained to me that it was probably too consumed...

#Go to milling 2' try

####(MachMate CNC -SPQWORK Roma)

### without error!! yhea!

****

It's monday! 23/03

unfortunately or fortunately, for about 10 years I working in Rome, 
thanks to the world of FabLab I met great people, like Tommaso Spagnoli e Sergio Subrizi from the FabLab SPQWORK.
Tommaso was fantastic and thanks to him I could carry out my assignment at its FabLab SPQWORK

![17]({{ site.url }}/images/week/8/foto/17.jpg)

Sergio Subrizi is really experienced in the use of the CNC, he built his splendid machmate!
and teach me the workflow:


![18]({{ site.url }}/images/week/8/foto/18.jpg)
![14]({{ site.url }}/images/week/8/foto/14.jpg)

the workflow described above changes only where there are asterisks

- Create Gcode in ASPIRE software**

- Open Gcode-file in MACH3**

- Fix the table/material over the CNC plane**
(for do this, Sergio teach me to create a additional file in Aspire to drill some point where the cnc does't work, and is possible use screw to fix the material to sacrifical layer)

- Set Zero CNC point (X,Y,Z)**
the Sergio MachMate have laser pointer and joystick to move the cnc axes! 
it's easy set Zero in X-Y axes and using a tuch probe set the Z axes.

	- Set Zero CNC point (X,Y,Z)**

![9]({{ site.url }}/images/week/8/foto/9.jpg)

	The new parametric joint works perfectly with the dimension of the drill tip !

#Conclusion

In this assignment I have had the opportunity to test 2 different cnc machine.
One in FabLab Cascina , big shapoko, that was slowly but works with and works without too bulky equipment.
And one in FABLAB SPQWORK a giant MachMate, splendid machine, built with professional attentions, with a lot of additional feature (joystick, laser pointer...)

so the point is that milling is not a joke. and as I have learned at spqWORK, the big cnc exist only as professional machine.
the speed and quality of result of a big work (big file to cut or milling) are depending of the power of motor and power of spindle.
It's impossible working a big file inside a non professional CNC.
