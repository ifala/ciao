### Weekly_Assignments :
- Redraw the echo hello-world board
- add (at least) a button and LED (with current-limiting resistor)
      check the design rules, and make it
- extra credit: simulate its operation

#####What I have used:
- ######Eletronics Design : [Eagle Freeware](http://www.cadsoftusa.com/download-eagle/)

# Design! in Eagle  

****

Following the istructor tutorial, I was totally new to eagle. Eagle is very easy program 
For create a board such as hello board you must simply load the necessary libraries, in this case I used the library FAB, 01_fab_Rhello and one suggested by our instructor SparkFun.

Una volta creato un nuovo progetto, si inizia ad aggiungere i componenti indicati nella tabella sopra. 
Once create a new project, I start to add some component.(indicated in the table above)
In Eagle you have 3 foundamental windows: 

- *schematic* where you can visualize and add components.
- *board* where you can move and build traces , design study of your new board.
- *control panel* where is possible activate and add libraries

in schematic window, there is 2 methods to create connection between components:

- link directly using a net

- or appoint the extremes with the same name

Tools--->ERC
performs a check on the connections to be corrected

Now I'm ready to draw the card and its physical connections in the window Board.

To draw the card I had to change the settings of the grid because the standard setting is too big.
view--->grid

I try to place the component most near as possible to try to have a very small card.
For the traces inside (under) the Attiny44 I had to change the traces dimension

then you must check the minimum distance between the tracks by:

file--->export--->image with this setting:

![normal]({{ site.url }}/images/week/6/11.jpg)
![normal]({{ site.url }}/images/week/6/12.jpg)

e apriamo il file .png con photoshop tagliamo il contorno della nostra scheda con un po di bordo
creiamo un nuovo livello per il taglio con i contorni bianchi della stessa dimensione del ritaglio.
ecco i 2 file creati 

Open the file with photoshop .png, crop the outline of your board with a bit of edge.
Create a new layer with white contour outlines of the same dimension of the crop.
here are the two files created:

![normal]({{ site.url }}/images/week/6/img/scheda.png)


**ATTENTION** 
to import the file in .png--->fab modules we must set 500 dpi, (such as the export of eagle) otherwise you mill a board of 30 cm! (default DPi in Fab modules are 72).

![normal]({{ site.url }}/images/week/6/13.jpg)

if you try to mill a giant 30cm board, the mdx-20 go straight to the extreme X axes and start from that point to mill!
fortunately I was near the machine
then I was able to stop Mdx-20 in time before the tip tuch the copper board.
