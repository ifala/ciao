### Weekly_Assignments :
	- Redraw the echo hello-world board
	- add (at least) a button and LED (with current-limiting resistor)
      check the design rules, and make it
	- extra credit: simulate its operation

#####What I have used:
- ######Eletronics Design : [Eagle Freeware](http://www.cadsoftusa.com/download-eagle/)
- ######[Roland MDX-20](http://www.rolanddg.com/product/3d/3d/mdx-20_15/mdx-20_15.html)

# Design! in Eagle  

****

I was totally new to eagle. that is a very easy program 
For creating board such as hello board I simply have to load the necessary libraries, in this case I used the library FAB, 01_fab_Rhello and one suggested by our instructor SparkFun in [this video tutorial](https://vimeo.com/120501993)

Once I have created a new project, I can start adding some components.(as indicated in the table above)
In Eagle you have 3 foundamental windows: 

- *schematic* where you can visualize and add components.
- *board* where you can move and build traces , design study of your new board.
- *control panel* where it is possible to activate and add libraries

in schematic window, there are 2 methods to create connection between components:

- linking them directly using a net

- or naming the extremes with the same name

Tools--->ERC
performs a check on the connections to be corrected

Now I'm ready to draw the card and its physical connections in the window Board.

To draw the card I had to change the settings of the grid because the standard setting was too big.

I try to place the components the nearest possible to have a very smaller board.
For the traces inside (under) the Attiny44 I had to change the traces dimension

then I had to check the minimum distance between the tracks with:

file--->export--->image with this setting:

![normal]({{ site.url }}/images/week/6/12.jpg)


I Opened the file with photoshop .png, cropped the outline of the board with a little edge.
I Created a new layer with white contour outlines of the same dimension of the crop.
here you are the two files I created:

![normal]({{ site.url }}/images/week/6/img/scheda.png)


**ATTENTION** 
In order to import the file in .png--->fab modules you have to set 500 dpi, (such as in the export on eagle) otherwise you will mill a board of 20 cm! (default DPi in Fab modules are 72).

![normal]({{ site.url }}/images/week/6/13.jpg)

When I tried to mill a giant 20cm board, the mdx-20 went straight to the extreme of X axes and started milling from that point !
fortunately I was near the machine
and I was able to stop Mdx-20 just in time before the tip touched the copper board.

**Final Result**
hello board with led and switch
