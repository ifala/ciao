#What I want 

### introduction

****

The idea was to create a javascript app call by wifi-ip address that run directly inside the memory of esp module , interfaced with RGB-Servo board that execute the changing color and the servo rotation.

### What I did

###ESP01

In the start I use ESP01 NodeMcu 0.9.4 build 20141230  powered by Lua 5.1.4
but when I start the server from the ip address and I call my index.html page with jquery.min.js ( for control the operation of button ) not give to me any response.
I started to find why, and I discover that the memory inside ESP01 is insufficent to "solve" (or charging) jquery.min.js !

error code:

~~~~~

###ESP8266 rev A (olimex)

In the second attempt I use ESP8266 revA by olimex - 
This time, the mcu have 2mb of capacity and I can upload all, without error.
Another problem is that is unable to auto-config the SAP (software access point) on the start
but if I give manually ( via FTDI) the command :

> dofile("httpserver.lc")(90)

the server start normally, so I decide to use Attiny44 to do this command (via RX pin of ESP) with a delay after the power on.

### APP JS

I start with a sample html file and I give some command using jquery.min.js
but...

The library is too slow for have a response on http server over the ESP8266!
I remove the ...

<script src="jquery.min.js"></script>

and I replaced by :

#Attiny44 Programming

****

To test the RGB and the servo CODE by Neil I modified the code originally created for the attiny45 and adapted it for attiny44.

- I removed the prescaler /8 because I don't use 20 MHz xtal on my board
- I re-set the pin direction/number

#Conclusion

****

Now I really want to try to write the code to control this board directly from the olimex esp8266!
I tried to find some tutorials to use esp8266. Since I still haven't found anything special, I would like to write a similar code that gets the commands directly from the FTDI to control servo and RGB. 

For sure before the networking week, I would have found or written a code simulating the functioning of my cube, so that I can test it via WIFI (using esp8266).
