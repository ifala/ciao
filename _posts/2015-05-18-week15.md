### Weekly_Assignments :

	-  For this assignment we need to answer some relevant questions about our final project.


****

####What will it do?

Twister is a wifi controlled small lego rotating cube with integrated application, it can connecting each other physically to create a control 3/4/5/6/7 axes robot arm, it can also be used to automate original lego pieces !

It can rotate on one face, change color,connect phisically by a lego original block, wifi connect automatically with other twister cube. 
Each twister cube can be a Server or client by click a button.
You can control via smartphone, PC, tablet simply connect to his wifi network.


####Who's done what beforehand?

####What materials and components will be required?

- PLA Rolls blue, green, yellow and red
- white acrilic
- one micro-servo motors
- one ESP8266 rev A
- one RGB3.3-Servo5 pcb built in Output device week.
- one RGB led common catode
- one battery 9v


####Where will they come from?

All electronics for RGB3.3-Servo5 pcb came from the fablab inventory (except [LM3940 1-A](http://www.ti.com/lit/ds/symlink/lm3940.pdf) )
I find a very good Pla rolls by [ColorFabb](http://colorfabb.com/pla-pha)  
acrilic sheet and battery buyed from local store
ESP 8266 rev A by [Olimex](https://www.olimex.com/Products/IoT/MOD-WIFI-ESP8266-DEV/open-source-hardware)


####How much will it cost?

- Printed parts ~3 Euros
- Servo motors HXT900 9g- 2.37 Euros
- white acrilic A4 format (sufficent for 2 cube)- 6 euros
- ESP8266 rev A - 5.50 Euros
- RGB3.3-Servo5 pcb componets - 4 Euros
- RGB led common catode - 0.20 euros
- Vinyl stikers - 2 euros

Total 23,07 euros

####What parts and systems will be made?

Physical parts:

Lasercut acrilyc case - Solidworks + Autocad (offset kerf)

3d Printed
 
- Solidworks 
- cube angle
- mechanism for cube rotation 
- Lego faces
	(It can be also molded)
- Laser cut acrilic external case 
- Stickers for the enclosure
- RGB3.3-Servo5 pcb

Software:

- Web app interface integrated inside the memory of eaech ESP8266 - javascript
- LuaMcu firmware, with servo + RGB library call + Client SERVER switch.
- Wifi trasmission.

####What processes will be used?

Lasercut - for external cube skeleton

3d printing - for cube angle,mechanism for cube rotation,Lego faces 

PCB Production - Rgb3.3SERVO5  

Vynil cutting - stickers for customizing the Companion looks and branding the box

Moldin and Casting - For Lego Faces

####What tasks need to be completed?

1 - improve the visual quality fo the web app

2 - Test the rotation movment

3 - Test the server-client connection between cubes

4 - Build at least 4 twister cube for perform Demostration

####What is the schedule?

May 20-22	  Modify Servo+RGB pcb for integrate 9v battery and switch button

May 22-26	  Complete the App and add some beauty icons on web interface

May 26-30	  To build 4 or 6 twister cube for create a demo test

May 31-June 10	  

####How will it be evaluated?

The evaluation will be carried by making a demo test to demostrate the easy connection with server and client connection, set the color of each cube for undestand the movment and build some things with cubes and perform a demo test. A further tests will be showing during the fab11 for the amusing children and adults alike.
