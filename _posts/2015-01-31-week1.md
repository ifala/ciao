#### set-up ”jekyll foudation markdown”

****


> After setting up a ready made foundation-jekyll-markdown web site as shown in/with [this tutorial](http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2014/08/01/build-blog-jekyll-github-pages/)

and following the tutorial instruction to set up the name of the repository (where I forked the ready made site) with “myusername.guthub.io” 

###### I'm now online!

****

#### git and github setting up 

****

I have clone a [template website](https://github.com/hmfaysal/Notepad) in my mac, I try to use also git via terminal and github with any problem.
I'd like use terminal but inside github I have some repository already set, and in startup it ask me this :
 
![normal]({{ site.url }}/images/week/1/giterror.jpg)

and so I have decided to continue to use the graphical version.

for modify the site I downloaded [Textmate](http://macromates.com/) , very useful to modify and write in various programming language.
 

****

### Install Jekyll

****

As described in [this tutorial](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/) the best way to install jekyll is via [rubygems](https://rubygems.org/pages/download)


Workflow:

- download/install [rubygems](https://rubygems.org/pages/download)
- Follow [Jekyll installation here](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/)
- Via terminal (OSX) go to the cloned folder of website template..and :

~~~~~

$ jekyll serve

~~~~~

- now, inside http://localhost:4000/ you started a development server where you can control the update of your site before update your github folder by using commit and sinc command. 

****

### Kramdown

****

For building a new post, you must create new file inside the folder _post with this type of configuration:

file: 2015-01-31-week1.md

~~~~~

---
layout: post //in this type of theme exist 3 type of layout: home - page - post 
title: "Principles and practices, project management" // add name of article/post
description: "week 1" // add some description 
category: Class_assignments // add_category 
tags: [jekyll, kramdown, gems, foundation] // add tags directly connected to post
imagefeature: principles-and-practices.jpg // add in the root site an image that is visualize in the start of page with animation (I prefer redimension and add some filter into image)
---  

~~~~~

Here you can write the text of your post/page...in KRAMDOWN 

- what is kramdown?

kramdown is a sub language for programming easy web page.
You write in kramdown (markdown alternative but very similar) and the jekyll serve translate/convert the code in html.

- Why use kramdown/markdown and not direct html code?

because is more fast and **intuitive** (for bold simply add before and after the world "**")

- where I can learn to use kramdown?

Kramdown (markdown too) is really well documented, [here](http://kramdown.gettalong.org/syntax.html) I finded all that I need to make page, insert image, tab, paragraphs etc etc.

### Foudation5

****

"Foudation is a responsive front-end framework" [wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foundation_(framework))

using the pre-compiled CSS file I gave a modern apparence to my site.

for a better experience of use consider to look the documentation [here](http://foundation.zurb.com/docs/)

****

### Font Anwsome

****





****

### top menu

****


![verybig]({{ site.url }}/images/week/1/textmate.jpg)

My menu:

~~~~~~~~

links:
  - title: Home
    url: /
    external: false
    icon: home
  - title: aboutME
    url: /about
  - title: final project
    url: /final_project
  - title: classes
    url: /classes

~~~~~~~~

****

### color and customize font 
**(updated 20/02/2015)**

****

I have created this file to change the font dimension to better control the image size and :

~~~~~~~~
---> /assets/css/vendor/custom.css
~~~~~~~~

~~~~~~~~
.latest_updates {
	list-style: none;
	margin-left: 0px;
	padding-left: 0px;
}

ul.latest_updates li {
	
	padding-left: 0px;
}


.notepad-page-content > div:not(.notepad-page-title) a, .notepad-page-content > div:not(.notepad-page-title) code {
	color: grey;
}

.notepad-page-content > div:not(.notepad-page-title) ul, .notepad-page-content > div:not(.notepad-page-title) ol {
padding-left: 0;
font-size: 1.125rem;
color: black;
}


img[alt="mini"] { 
  max-width:  200px; 
}

img[alt="normal"] { 
  max-width:  450px; 
}

img[alt="big"] { 
  max-width:  600px; 
}

img[alt="verybig"] { 
  max-width:  800px; 
}
~~~~~~~~

Some example to better undestanding difference between image dimension:



original image size (800x600) ![]({{ site.url }}/images/week/1/test.jpg) 

**verybig** image size max-width:800px ![verybig]({{ site.url }}/images/week/1/test.jpg) 

**big** image size max-width:600px ![big]({{ site.url }}/images/week/1/test.jpg) 

**normal** image size max-width:450px ![normal]({{ site.url }}/images/week/1/test.jpg) 

**mini** image size max-width:200px ![mini]({{ site.url }}/images/week/1/test.jpg) 

and add the path file in:

~~~~~~~~
_/includes/head.html_

    <link rel="stylesheet" href="{{ site.url }}/assets/css/vendor/normalize.css">
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="{{ site.url }}/assets/css/vendor/nprogress.css">
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="{{ site.url }}/assets/css/vendor/foundation.min.css">
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="{{ site.url }}/assets/css/style.css">
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="{{ site.url }}/assets/css/post.css">
--->    <link rel="stylesheet" href="{{ site.url }}/assets/css/custom.css">
~~~~~~~~
This is the sequence of files for file creation final css.

****

### difference post visualize btw classes / final project

****

I wanted to see in a different way the two page, the **classes** page only visualize the post inside _post folder_ which have *categories = class_assignments* in reverse "reversed" list of insert date:


~~~~~~~~
\`{% for post in site.categories.class_assignments reversed %}\`
\`<ul class="post-list">\`
\`<li><time datetime="{{ post.date | date_to_xmlschema }}" itemprop="datePublished"><span\` \`class="6-psecondary radius label">{{ post.date | date: "%d %B" }}</span></time> | <a href="{{\` \`site.url }}{{ post.url }}">{{ post.title }}</a></li>\`
\`</ul>\`
\`{% endfor %}\`
~~~~~~~~

I can't find the code mode syntax to visualize the correct information but is like:

open with {+% for post in site.categories.*class_assignments* reversed closed with %+}

![verybig]({{ site.url }}/images/week/1/code.jpg)

[***final project page***]({{ site.url }}/final_project/) only visualize the post inside _post folder_ which have *featured: true*. 

	

## What I learned

To build my own site, is funny ! jekyll-kramdown-foudation5 and also font anwsome are really easy to implement in the site, and online you can find a lot of example for using it!
Definitely in this week I discovered a new method to build a very good site,fast and easy to update using github! 
To search final project is difficult for my mind. 
In the end I followed the way to learn something new thing about electronic and programming, unexplored world for me.

here is list of "focus thing" that I will learn/improve:

+ understand electronics components
+ microcontroller programming 
+ programming some micro for control it
+ wireless comunication between own "hardware made"
+ programming apps to control it

in the end but not of minor importance, I want something **modular!**
