# How to set-up ”jekill bootstrap markdown” site in android smartphone

****

###### During this week I haven't had access to my Macbook and I have been building my whole website on my Android smartphone. (Nexus 4 - android 4.4)

obviously I will redesign the template once I get back home.

> After setting up a ready made bootstrap-jekill-markdown web site as shown in/with [this tutorial](http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2014/08/01/build-blog-jekyll-github-pages/ )

and following the tutorial instruction to set up the name of the repository (where I forked the ready made site) with “myusername.guthub.io” 

###### I'm now online!

## Apps downloaded 

###### from android store.

- [sgit](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=me.sheimi.sgit)
 
With this app you can start to improve your commit...pull ..push !

### Sgit setting

first of all we have to clone own repository inside the memory of smartphone or tablet

> remote url : https://github.com/username/yourusername.github.io

> local url : (this app work only inside the folder / storage/Android/git/... so at this point you must create your folder where the git can clone your repository)

> username: (your username inside github in this case)

> password: (your password inside github in this case)
